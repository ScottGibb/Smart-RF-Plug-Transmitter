## Building Instructions
The file contains the instructions for scanning your own plugs and adding it to the flow diagrams in Node Red. 
As discussed in the README.md, the system is using Docker to containerise the key subsystems.

## Scanning the Plug Frequency
If the developer has a different set of plugs than those specified in the ReadMe. The entire system can still work. 
It means extra work will be needed to ensure NodeRed can communicate with the Plugs

In order to scan the frequency that the plug uses, three bits of equipment are needed:
- Logic Analyser - Required for Seeing the Signals Transmitted by the Remote
- 433MHz Receiver - Required to receive the On, Off signals from the remote
- RF Plugs Remote - Required to send the On, Off Signals
- Some form of power source (Raspberry Pi,Bench Power Supply)
- Laptop m- To View the Logic Analyser Signals
